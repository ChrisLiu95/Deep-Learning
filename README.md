# Deep-Learning
I'm currently taking Deep learning Course in Cousera. This series of course contain:
Course 1:neural networks and deep learning
Course 2:Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
Course 3:Structuring Machine Learning Projects
Course 4:Convolutional Neural Networks
Course 5:Sequence Models

Andrew is an amazing man! I'll post several projects here if possible.
